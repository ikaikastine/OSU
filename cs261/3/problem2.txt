1. Which of the implemenations uses more memory? Explain why.

The linked list implementation uses more memory, because each time
malloc is called, it is storing a little extra memory. Also each link stores
both the value, and two pointers. The entire struct also has count which uses
more memory.  



2. Which of the implementation is the fastest? Explain why.

The linked list implementation is faster because it has O(1) when adding,
while the dynamic array implementation is O(1+). 



3. Would you expect anything to change if the loop performed remove() instead
of contains()? If so, what? 

If it ran remove() the dynamic array would have an O(n) since it has to shift
n elements to remove that one while Linked list would have O(1)
