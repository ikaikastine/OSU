Welcome to the Oregon State University ECE111 lab project software documentation.

Most software projects have a README.txt file in their root directory.  README.txt is intended to be the first file that is read to get information about the project.  Since you are reading this, you have obviously found the README for the ECE111 projects.  This directory contains documentation for all of the microcontroller projects used in the lab portion of ECE111.

Included files and directories:

example.c, example.h

	Is an educational document that includes examples of microcontroller c code in the context of a simple program.
	We recommend reading through this file before trying to understand the source code for the projects.

Lab 1 Introduction

	Hardware only.  Does not use software.

Lab 2 Materials Devices

	Hardware only. Does not use software

Lab 3 Signals Systems

	In this lab you will build a piano which functions based on the measured resistance across a graphite strip.

	Embedded programming topics discussed: Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), hardware timers, interrupts, sound generation

	The level of documentation in this project is well beyond that expected of a typical program.
	The extra documentation is there to assist beginning C programmers in understanding the code.  

Lab 4 Energy Systems

	In this lab you will build a circuit that drives a motor, controlling its speed and direction.

	Embedded programming topics discussed: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal generation.

Lab 5 Robotics and Control

	In this lab you will build a servo motor which uses a feedback control system to control the position of a motor.

	Embedded programming topics discussed: Feedback systems

Lab 6 Energy Systems
	In this lab, you will use the servo motor code to control the position of a solar cell.  
	The solar tracker you build will search for the brightest position ever time it detects a change in the brightness of the sun.

	Embedded programming topics discussed: Feedback systems
