Algorithm 1: Enumeration

enumeration(array of integers)
	max sum = 0
	for i = 0 to length of array
		for j = i to length of array
			new sum = sum of array from i to j+1
			if new sum > max sum 
				max sum = new sum 
				
This algorithm will add two numbers together for however long the array is twice
		
Algorithm 2: Better Enumeration

betterEnumeration(array of integers)
	max sum = 0
	for i = 0 to length of array
		old sum = 0
		for j = i to length of array
			if j = 0
				newSum = array[i]
			else
				new sum = oldSum = array[j]
			if newSum > newSum
				maxSum = newSum
			oldSum = newSum

Algorithm 3: Dynamic Progamming

dynamicProgramming(array of integers)
	best = 0
	cur = 0
	for i in array
		cur = max(cur + i, 0)
		best = max(best, cur)
